# 100 Pandas & Polars Puzzles

Inspired by [100 Pandas Puzzles](https://github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles) by [Alex Riley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajcriley/), this repo contains **100 short data manipulation puzzles**, solved **side-by-side in Pandas and Polars**.

Will help to understand **how similar problems are approached in both libraries**, and where their mental models differ.

## What you’ll find

- 🧩 A single Jupyter notebook with incremental puzzles  
- 🐼 Pandas solutions  
- 🐻‍❄️ Polars solutions  

Most puzzles are intentionally short and solvable in a few lines.

## Who this is for

- People comfortable with Pandas who want to **learn Polars**
- Data folks curious about **performance-oriented dataframe libraries**
- Anyone who learns best by **solving small, focused problems**

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maleek004/100-pandas-polars-puzzles.git
cd 100-pandas-polars-puzzles
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
